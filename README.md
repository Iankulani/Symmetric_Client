# Symmetric_Client
Symmetric client. This repository contains a symmetric encryption client application. The client communicates with a server using symmetric encryption (such as AES or DES) to encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged between them. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, ensuring secure data transmission over potentially insecure channels.
